# Welcome to the DermaLog. 

This is my submission for Flatiron's Phase 2 project. This project was built using the Sinatra Framework for Ruby and SQLite as a database. This project was inspired by my own skin woes. I wanted to create a simple application that was simple to use to keep track of a user's skin health and daily changes. A user can signup, login, and the application ensures that only the user can access their data. A user can also create new logs, edit and delete any past logs. 

## To view
run `bundle install`     

run `shotgun` in your terminal to view application in the browser

Signup to get access to the app and start logging!

## Stretch Goals
The current state of the project is the Minimum Viable Project. After my bootcamp, I would like to extend the functionality of the application. A few things I'd like to do is.. 
-Allow a user to upload images when creating a log
-Create social functionality where a user can share their logs publically, have others recommend products
